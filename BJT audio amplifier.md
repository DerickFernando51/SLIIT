# BJT audio amplifier design

# Introduction
A bipolar junction transistor is a semiconductor device that consists of two p-n junctions.
It has three terminals known as the base, the emitter and the collector. One of its primary
functions is amplification. Amplification is the process of magnifying a weak input signal to a
larger level. In a BJT the waveform applied to the emitter terminal is amplified and produced at
the collector terminal.

The objective of this assignment is to design a DC biasing circuit. Initially, the values of
the required components will be obtained by analyzing the circuit. Then the accuracy of the
circuit will be confirmed using simulation software. Finally, the circuit will be physically
implemented and tested.
